    "# The Canonical Ensemble\n",
    "In statistical mechanics, an ensemble is a large set of imaginary copies of a system, considered under the same macroscopic conditions. In the canonical ensemble, each system in the ensemble is in thermal contact with a heat reservoir at a fixed temperature $T$ (the system can exchange energy with the environment, but has fixed volume and number of particles). The probability of finding the system in a particular microstate $s$ with energy $E_s$ is given by the Boltzmann distribution:\n",
    "$$P_s = \\frac{e^{-E_s/k_B T}}{Z}$$\n",
    "where $k_B$ is Boltzmann’s constant and $Z$ is the normalization constant. Since the probabilities must sum to 1,\n",
    "$$Z = \\sum_s e^{-E_s/k_B T}$$\n",
    "summing over all possible microstates $s$. This quantity $Z$ is called the partition function of the system. It encodes the statistical properties of the system and ensures $P_s$ is properly normalized.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the Boltzmann distribution, we can compute ensemble averages of physical quantities. The ensemble average of an observable $A$ is defined as $\\langle A \\rangle = \\sum_s A_s P_s$. In particular, the mean energy is:\n",
    "$$\\langle E\\rangle = \\sum_s E_s P_s = \\frac{1}{Z}E_s e^{-\\beta E_s}$$\n",
    "with $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$. (In these equations, $E_s$ and $A_s$ are the energy and the value of $A$ in microstate $s$.)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using The Metropolis algorithm\n",
    "In practice, for a system with many degrees of freedom, the sum over all microstates is astronomically large and cannot be evaluated directly. We therefore use Monte Carlo methods to estimate ensemble averages by sampling representative states. For a general observable $A$, the exact ensemble average is\n",
    "$$\\langle A\\rangle = \\frac{1}{Z} \\sum_s A_s e^{-\\beta E_s}$$\n",
    "The idea of Monte Carlo sampling is to generate a representative set of $m$ configurations (microstates) and approximate the average by a sample mean:\n",
    "$$\\langle A\\rangle \\approx \\frac{1}{Z} \\sum_s^m A_s e^{-\\beta E_s}$$\n",
    "where the sum is over the sampled configurations.\n",
    "\n",
    "A crude Monte Carlo approach would be to generate configurations completely at random, calculate $A_s e^{-\\beta E_s}$ for each, and average. This is equivalent to the “hit-and-miss” method for evaluating integrals. However, this approach is very inefficient because most randomly chosen states have extremely low Boltzmann weight $e^{-\\beta E}$ and contribute almost nothing to the average. Instead, we prefer to sample important configurations -those with large $e^{-\\beta E_s}$ – more frequently. This strategy is called *importance sampling*. The most convenient choice is to generate configurations with probability proportional to the Boltzmann weight itself $P_s$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we sample states with the Boltzmann probability $P_s$, then each sampled state $s$ is already weighted correctly in the average. In that case, the estimator for the ensemble average simplifies to the simple arithmetic mean of the observable over the $m$ sampled configurations:\n",
    "$$\\langle A\\rangle \\approx \\frac{1}{m}\\sum_{s=1}^m A_s$$\n",
    "since each sampled $A_s$ effectively represents $A_s/P_s$ weighted by $e^{-\\beta E_s}$ (and the normalization factors cancel) – we are averaging with respect to the distribution $P_s$ itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "To generate sample states with probability $P_s$, we perform a random walk in configuration space using the Metropolis Monte Carlo algorithm. The Monte Carlo procedure constructs a sequence of configurations $i \\to j \\to \\dots$ such that the fraction of time spent in each state corresponds to $P_s$. One way to ensure this is to design the transition probability $W(i\\to j)$ between states $i$ and $j$ to satisfy detailed balance:\n",
    "$$W(i\\rightarrow j)e^{-\\beta E_i} = W(j\\rightarrow i)e^{-\\beta E_j}$$\n",
    "A convenient choice is the Metropolis choice:\n",
    "$$W(i\\rightarrow j) = min\\left(1,P_j/P_i\\right) = min(1,e^{-\\beta(E_j-E_i)})$$\n",
    "We see that the partition function $Z$ cancels in the ratio $P_j/P_i$, so we don’t need to know it explicitly. Moves that lead to a lower energy ($E_j < E_i$) have $P_j/P_i > 1$, so $W=1$ (always accepted). Moves that increase the energy are accepted with probability $e^{-\\beta \\Delta E}$, where $\\Delta E = E_j - E_i > 0$. (This choice of $W$ is not unique – any transition rule satisfying detailed balance will eventually produce the Boltzmann distribution. For example, another common choice is $W(i\\to j) = 1/\\left(e^{-\\beta (E_j - E_i)} + 1\\right)$, which would give $W=1/2$ if $\\Delta E=0$.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the Metropolis criterion, we can outline the Monte Carlo simulation algorithm as follows:\n",
    "1. Establish an initial configuration. This means set the starting values of all degrees of freedom (for example, assign an initial velocity to each particle in a gas, or an initial orientation to each spin in a spin system).\n",
    "2. Make a random trial change in the configuration. For example, in a spin system you might flip a randomly chosen spin. In our 1D gas example, you could pick one particle at random and modify its velocity by a small random amount.\n",
    "3. Compute the change in the energy $\\Delta E$ due to the trial change. That is, calculate $E_j - E_i$ between the new trial state and the old state. (For an ideal gas particle with mass $m=1$, $\\Delta E = \\tfrac{1}{2}(v_{\\text{trial}}^2 - v_{\\text{old}}^2)$.)\n",
    "4. If $\\Delta E \\le 0$, accept the new configuration. In this case the trial move lowers (or leaves unchanged) the energy, so it is automatically accepted as the new state. (Such moves make the configuration more probable or equally probable.)\n",
    "5. If $\\Delta E > 0$, compute the transition probability $W = e^{-\\beta \\Delta E}$. This is the probability of accepting an energy-increasing move, derived from the Boltzmann factor. A larger increase in energy leads to a smaller $W$.\n",
    "6. Generate a random number $r$ uniformly in $[0,1]$.\n",
    "7. If $r \\le W$, accept the new configuration; otherwise, reject it. In other words, even if the energy rises, accept the move with probability $W$. If the move is rejected, the system stays in the previous state for this step. (This step allows the system to occasionally absorb energy from the thermal reservoir, mimicking contact with a heat bath.)\n",
    "8. Repeat steps 2–7 to obtain a long sequence of configurations (Monte Carlo steps). Each accepted move changes the state. After many such random trials, the system will wander through configuration space according to $W$, sampling states with the desired Boltzmann probabilities.\n",
    "9. After equilibration, compute averages using the generated configurations. Once the system has reached thermal equilibrium, you can estimate observables as averages over the sampled configurations (ignoring the initial “warm-up” period). These sample averages correspond to the ensemble averages $\\langle A \\rangle$ in the canonical ensemble."

    "## Important conditions for validity\n",
    "For the Monte Carlo sampling to be valid, two conditions are important: detailed balance and ergodicity. The Metropolis choice of $W$ above ensures detailed balance. Ergodicity means that it must be possible for the random walk to eventually reach any configuration of the system. The chosen set of trial moves should be capable of exploring the entire phase space given enough time. If some regions of configuration space are inaccessible (for example, due to only making very local moves), then one should introduce additional moves or algorithms to ensure the system can fully explore all states."

    "In this case, we assume that the particles do not interact and the particle velocities are continuous and unbounded. The energy of the system is the sum of the kinetic energies of the individual particles. Hence, for an ideal gas, the only coordinates of interest are the velocities of the particles. To change a configuration, we choose a particle at random and change its velocity by a random amount according to the Metropolis transition probability. For simplicity we consider only the one-dimensional case. \n",
