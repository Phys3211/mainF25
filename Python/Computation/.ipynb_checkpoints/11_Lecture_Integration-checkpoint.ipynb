    "## Quadrature\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "**Quadrature** is the process of determining the area under a curve by approximating it with geometric shapes. The term originates from the idea of finding a square with an equivalent area to a given region.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "There are many numerical techniques to perform quadrature, but we will focus on four fundamental methods:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "* **Trapezoid Rule** – Approximates the area using trapezoids.  \r\n",
    "* **Simpson’s Rule** – Uses parabolic segments for improved accuracy.  \r\n",
    "* **Romberg Integration** – Refines the Trapezoidal Rule using Richardson extrapolation.  \r\n",
    "* **Gaussian Quadrature** – Achieves high accuracy by strategically choosing evaluation points and weights.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Each of these methods is based on the fundamental principle of approximating an integral as a weighted sum of function values:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "$$\r\n",
    "\\int_a^b f(x) dx \\approx \\sum_{k=1}^N f(x_k) \\omega_k\r\n",
    "$$\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "where:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "* $N = \\frac{b - a}{h}$ is the number of integration steps,  \r\n",
    "* $h = x_{k+1} - x_k$ is the step size between successive points,  \r\n",
    "* $\\omega_k$ represents weighting factors that depend on the chosen quadrature method.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "The choice of method and the number of steps $N$ directly impact the accuracy of numerical integration. Simpler methods like the Trapezoid Rule work well for smooth functions but may require many steps for precision. More advanced techniques, such as Gaussian Quadrature, can achieve high accuracy with fewer evaluations by carefully selecting points $x_k$ and weights $\\omega_k$.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "In the following sections, we will explore each method, discussing their derivations, ad\n",
    "vantages, and applications.\n",
    "## Trapezoid Rule\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the simplest numerical integration methods is the **Trapezoid Rule**, which approximates the area under a curve by dividing it into a series of trapezoids. Instead of approximating the function with rectangles (as in Riemann sums), we use trapezoids to achieve a more accurate estimate of the integral.\n",
    "\n",
    "The integral we seek to approximate is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$I(a, b) = \\int_a^b f(x) dx$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The area of a single trapezoid, with base width $h$ and heights given by function values at two consecutive points, is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$A_k = \\frac{1}{2} h [ f(a + (k - 1)h) + f(a + kh) ]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Summing over all $N$ trapezoids from $x = a$ to $x = b$, we obtain the Trapezoid Rule approximation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$I(a, b) \\approx \\frac{1}{2} h \\sum_{k=1}^N \\left[ f(a + (k - 1)h) + f(a + kh) \\right]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Rearranging the summation, we can rewrite this as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$I(a, b) \\approx h \\left[ \\frac{1}{2} f(a) + \\frac{1}{2} f(b) + \\sum_{k=1}^{N-1} f(a + kh) \\right]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This formulation highlights an important computational advantage:  \n",
    "- The function values at the interior points are summed once.  \n",
    "- The function values at the endpoints ($a$ and $b$) are weighted by $\\frac{1}{2}$ to avoid double-counting.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Trapezoid Rule provides a straightforward yet effective method for numerical integration, especially when dealing with smooth functions. However, for highly curved functions, higher-order methods like **Simpson’s Rule** may offer improved accuracy with fewer steps.\n"

    "\r\n",
    "While the Trapezoid Rule approximates the function with linear segments, **Simpson’s Rule** takes it a step further by fitting the function with a quadratic interpolation. This provides a more accurate estimate, especially for functions that exhibit curvature.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### Quadratic Interpolation\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "To derive Simpson’s Rule, we approximate the function using a quadratic polynomial:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "$f(x) = Ax^2 + Bx + C$\r\n",
    "\r\n",

    "## Motivation: Why Gaussian Quadrature?\n",
    "\n",
    "In previous methods like the **Trapezoid Rule** and **Simpson’s Rule**, we evaluated the function at evenly spaced points and computed the integral as a weighted sum of these values. These methods work well but are not always the most **efficient**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gaussian Quadrature improves upon this by:\n",
    "- Choosing **both the evaluation points and the weights optimally** rather than using evenly spaced intervals.\n",
    "- Providing **higher accuracy with fewer function evaluations** compared to equally spaced quadrature methods.\n",
    "- Allowing integration of higher-order polynomials exactly with fewer points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of using fixed intervals, Gaussian Quadrature finds the **best possible** nodes $x_i$ and corresponding weights $\\omega_i$ so that the integral:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "I = \\int_a^b f(x) dx\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "is approximated as:\n",
    "\n",

    "I \\approx \\sum_{i=1}^n \\omega_i f(x_i)\n",

    "where:\n",
    "- $x_i$ are the **quadrature nodes** (carefully chosen points in the integration range).\n",
    "- $\\omega_i$ are the **weights** assigned to each function evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Gaussian Quadrature and Orthogonal Polynomials\n",
    "\n",
    "The key idea behind Gaussian Quadrature is that **polynomial functions of degree $2n-1$ or lower can be integrated exactly using only $n$ points**. This is accomplished by choosing $x_i$ as the **roots of a special orthogonal polynomial**.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "- **Legendre polynomials** for standard **Gauss-Legendre Quadrature**.\n",

    "\n",
    "The integral is computed using the roots of these polynomials as evaluation points.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Gauss-Legendre Quadrature\n",

    "For standard integrals of the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "the **Legendre polynomials** $P_n(x)$ determine the quadrature nodes $x_i$ as their roots. The weights $\\omega_i$ are chosen such that any polynomial of degree up to $2n-1$ is integrated exactly.\n",

    "For an arbitrary integral over $[a, b]$, we perform a **change of variables**:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "x = \\frac{b-a}{2} t + \\frac{b+a}{2}\n",

    "The simple harmonic oscillator crops up in many places. Its behaviors can be studied readily using analytic methods and it has the important property that its period of oscillation is constant, independent of its amplitude, making it useful, for instance, for keeping time in watches and clocks. \n",
    "Frequently in physics, however, we also come across anharmonic oscillators, whose period varies with amplitude and whose behavior cannot usually be calculated analytically. A general classical oscillator can be thought of as a particle in a concave potential well. When disturbed, the particle will rock back and forth in the well. The harmonic oscillator corresponds to a quadratic potential $V(x)\\sim x^2$. Any other form gives an anharmonic oscillator.\n",
    "One way to calculate the motion of an oscillator is to write down the equation for the conservation of energy in the system. If the particle has a mass *m* and position *x*, then the total energy is equal to the sum of the kinetic and potential energies thus: $$E = \\frac{1}{2}m\\left(\\frac{dx}{dt}\\right)^2 + V(x).$$ Since the energy must be constant over time, this equation is effectively a differential equation linking *x* and *t*. \n",
    "Let us assume that the potential $V(x)$ is symmetric about $x=0$ and let us set our anharmonic oscillator going with amplitude *a* and it swings back towards the origin. Then at $t=0$ we have $dx/dt=0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "(a) Convince yourself that the period of this oscillator is $$T = \\int_{0}^{a} \\frac{dx}{\\sqrt{V(a)-V(x)}}$$.\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) Write a program in Python that takes the amplitude *a* and a lambda function for $V(x)$ as arguments and calculates the period of an harmonic/anharmonic oscillator with a mass $m=1$. Use a potential form $V(x) = x^2$, $V(x)=x^4$, and the Morse potential $V(r) = D_e(1-e^{-a(r-r_e)^2})$, where $D_e$ is the well depth and $a = \\sqrt{k_e/2D_e}$, $k_e$ represents the force constant at the minimum of the well. Experiment with different integral functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "(c) Use your function to make a graph of the period for amplitudes ranging from $a=0$ to $a=4$. Do the results match your physical intuition?\n",
    "\n",
    "(d) If we extend consideration to 3 dimensions where $V(x)\\rightarrow V(r)\\sim r^2$ and only consider radial motion, we see that the results are the same as the 1 dimensional case. What happens when we consider angular momentum? Repeat (a)-(c) in the case of 3D motion with angular momentum about the equilibrium point of a spherical pendulum. "
