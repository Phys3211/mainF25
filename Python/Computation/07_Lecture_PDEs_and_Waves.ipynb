    "# Waves: A dive into PDEs\n",

    "So far we have mostly dealt with ODEs. However, wave propagation is described with a partial differential equation (PDE). In general, it is much harder to solve PDEs than ODEs because a PDE has at least two independent variables whereas an ODE contains only one. We have systematic methods such as the Runge-Kutta scheme that are applicable to most initial value problems involving ODEs. For PDEs, however, few such widely applicable approaches exist. The correct method depends on the kind of problems, and the type of boundary conditions. So, we are going to look at different classes of problems.\n",

    "Imagine a pulse propagating in a string. As the wave travels each segment of the string moves up and down perpendicular to the direction of propagation. At the macroscopic level, we observe a transverse wave that moves along the string, and the individual motion of the segments is not relevant. In contrast, at the microscopic level, we see discrete particles undergoing oscillatory motion perpendicular to the motion of the wave.\n",

    "In a string, a solid, or a fluid, the collective motion of the particles determine the velocity of sound waves in the medium, as well as the thermal transport properties.\n",
