    "# Reinforcement Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Today's topic, Reinforcement Learning, gets us close to what people might traditionally imagine when they hear \"artificial intelligence.\" You might not instinctively call a network that identifies handwritten digits \"intelligent\", but you might apply that word to a program that learns to play chess or a robot that figures out how to walk. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a subfield of machine learning that tackles precisely these kinds of problems - where an agent learns to act intelligently through interaction with its environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Core Concepts\n",
    "Think of reinforcement learning like teaching a dog a trick - the dog (agent) interacts with its surroundings (environment), and through trial and error, it figures out which actions lead to good outcomes (treats).\n",
    "\n",
    "The essential components of RL:\n",
    "- an *agent* is exploring an *environment.*\n",
    "- at any given time, the agent perceives a *state* of the environment, $s\\in S$.\n",
    "- the agent can take *actions*, $a\\in A$, that influence the environment and move it to a new state.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Policy Function\n",
    "How does the agent decide what action to take? This is governed by a policy $\\pi: \\rightarrow A$, a function that maps states to actions. The policy might be *deterministic* or *stochastic*, conditioned on the state.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the agent follows its policy, it generates a trajectory through state space - a sequence of states and actions. This trajectory either continues indefinitely or ends in a terminal state, such as winning a games or reaching a physical goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rewards and Return\n",
    "At each time step $t$, the agent receives a reward $r_t$, which is a number that tells it how \"good\" or \"bad\" the outcome of its action was. These rewards accumulate into a *return*:\n",
    "$$G_t = \\Sigma_0^{\\inf} \\gamma^k r_{t+k+1}.$$\n",
    "Here, $\\gamma \\in[0,1]$ is a *discount factor* that controls how much the agent values future rewards. A $gamma$ close to 0 makes the agent short-sighted; a $gamma$ close to 1 makes it value long-term planning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Value Functions\n",
    "To help the agent evaluate decisions, we define:\n",
    "- *state value function(s)* - $v_\\pi(s) = \\mathbb{E}_\\pi[G_t|S_t=s]$. This is the expected return if the agent starts in state $s$ and follows policy $\\pi$\n",
    "- *action value function(s)* - $q_{\\pi}(s,a) = \\mathbb{E}_\\pi[G_t|S_t=s,A_t=a]$. This tells us how good it is to take action $a$ in state $s$, assuming we follow policy $\\pi$ thereafter. \n",
    "\n",
    "## The Goal of RL\n",
    "The ultimate goal is to find a policy $\\pi$ that maximizes expected return over time. Two major methods are used:\n",
    "- Value-based methods: First estimate $v_{\\pi}(s)$ or $q_\\pi(s,a)$, then derive the policy from it.\n",
    "- Policy-based methods: Directly optimize the policy to maximize expected return. these are often called policy gradient methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "## When to use RL\n",
    "To decide whether reinforcment learning is the right approach for your problem, you should ask: \n",
    "- Is there a natural framing in terms of an agent exploring an environment?\n",
    "- Can the agent take discrete or continuous actions that affect outcomes?\n",
    "- Is there a clear notion of reward? What counts as good or bad?\n",
    "If so, RL may be appropriate\n",
    "\n",
    "In some simple environments (like in small grids or short games), you can exhaustively try all possible states and actions. But in complex environments with huge state spaces (think Chess, Go, or String Theory parameter landscapes), brute force becomes unrealistic. In those cases, we use function approximation - usually using neural networks - to estimate value functions or policies. This gives rise to the modern and powerful field of *deep reinforcement learning*\n",
    "\n",
    "For more on RL, see:\n",
    "- [Sutton and Barto](http://incompleteideas.net/book/the-book-2nd.html), a famous early textbook.\n",
    "- [David Silver's course](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/d.silver/web/Teaching.html), a more modern take. The videos were my entry point into RL.\n",
    "- [AlphaZero](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature24270), a 2017 breakthrough in which RL achieves superhuman gameplay in Go *without human knowledge*, i.e. only via knowledge of the game and self-play. It was extended to Chess and Shogi in 2018. See the arXiv article here: [Mastering Chess and Shogi by Self-Play with a General Reinforcement Learning Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.01815).\n",
    "- My friends and I introduced RL into string theory in [Branes with Brains](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.11616). We have also used it to [find unknots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.16263) and [ribbons](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09304), the latter in connection with the smooth 4d PoincarÃ© conjecture.\n"

    "# Gridworld\n",
    "\n",
    "In this class we'll study a famous game in RL called *Gridworld*, see. e.g. Sutton and Barto for more. It's a simple game that is easy to understand, but still has some interesting features. The game is played on a grid, and the agent can move up, down, left, or right. The agent starts in a random position, and the goal is to reach the goal state, which is chosen via the policy.\n",
    "The game ends when the agent reaches the goal."
