    "# Electrostatics\n",
    "The majority of electrostatics can be summarized with two of Maxwell's equations and the Lorentz force. Gauss's Law relates the electric field to the charge distribution $\\rho$ and the permittivity of free space $\\epsilon_0$,  \n",
    "$$\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{E} = \\frac{\\rho}{\\epsilon_0}$$\n",
    "This equation expresses that electric field lines originate on positive charges and terminate on negative charges.\n",
    "\n",
    "The electrostatic field $\\vec{E}$ lacks a curl,\n",
    "$$\\nabla \\times \\vec{E} = 0$$\n",
    "which leads to the fact that electrostatic fields are conservative and can be derived from a scalar potential, $\\vec{E} = -\\nabla V$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The interaction of the electric field with charged particles are described by Lorentz force law,\n",
    "$$\\vec{F} = q\\vec{E}$$\n",
    "indicating that a charge $q$ experiences a force in the direction of the field.\n",
    "\n",
    "Electrostatics primarily deals with stationary charges, leading to time-independent fields. This framework provides the foundation for concepts such as Coulomb’s law, electric potential, and capacitance, all of which play crucial roles in classical electromagnetism and modern electrical applications.\n",

    "# Electrostatic potentials\n",
    "\n",
    "The electrostatic potential $V$ is a scalar function that simplifies the description of electric fields. It arises naturally from the conservative natural of the electrostatic forces. We can directly relate the electrostatic potential to the charge distribution using Gauss's Law,\n",
    "$$\\nabla \\cdot(-\\nabla V) = \\frac{\\rho}{\\epsilon_0}\\Rightarrow \\nabla^2 V = -\\frac{\\rho}{\\epsilon_0}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of potential is particularly useful in solving electrostatic problems, as it often simplifies boundary-value problems and provides insight into energy storage in electric fields, as seen in capacitors and other electrostatic systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that we are given the electrical potential in the boundaries of some region, and we want to find the potential $V(\\mathbf{r})$ inside that region. Once we know $V$ we can use the relation $\\mathbf{E}=-\\nabla V(\\mathbf{r})$ to determine $\\mathbf{E}$. This is a “boundary problem”. We know from classical electrodinamics (Gauss’ Law) that the potential $V(x,y,z)$ satisfies Poisson’s equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\nabla^2V(x,y,z)=-\\frac{\\rho(x,y,z)}{\\epsilon_0}$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "where\n",
    "$$\\nabla ^2V = \\frac{\\partial ^2V}{\\partial x^2} +\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial ^2V}{\\partial y^2} +\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial ^2V}{\\partial z^2},$$ \n",
    "and $\\rho$, the charge density inside the region. Besides satisfying Poisson's equation, $V$ must also satisify the boundary conditions. Because the shape of the region can be arbitrary, we often need computational methods to solve the problem. In the particular situation that there are no charges inside\n",
    "the region, the problem reduces to solving “Laplace’s equation”,\n",
    "$$\\nabla ^2V(x,y,z)=0.$$ \n",
    "As we did in the previous examples of PDE’s, we can discretize the derivatives and transform the equation to a finite differences problem. From now on we worry only about the two-dimensional case. We discretize the region in a grid with points $(x,y)$ separated by intervals $(\\Delta x, \\Delta y)$. The second derivatives are approximated by: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial^2 V(x,y)}{\\partial x^2} &\\simeq&\n",

    "That is, the value of $V(x,y)$ is given by the **average of the values** in the neighboring nodes in the grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Units\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the charge of the electron is $e=1.6 \\times 10^{-19} C$. From a microscopic point of view, the Coulomb is a very large unit of\n",
    "charge. Hence, we expect that for many simulations, it is advantageous to choose different units.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The finite differences algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that we are given the values of $V(x,y)$ in the boundaries of a rectangular area. If we divide the rectangle into a grid, we can the apply the difference method to calculate the values of $V$ inside. However, we notice that if we apply this equation at a point in the middle, we get zero as a result. So the first obvious observation is that the initial estimate for the method can not be a constant value. It is evident now that the procedure has to be iterative. We start from the bottom-left corner, and we sweep across the grid. As we obtain the first estimate for $V$, we repeat the sweep until the values of $V$ do not change considerably, and we can say that we have converged with certain accuracy. Here we have started with the initial values $V(x,y)$ inside the grid that in principle can be any initial guess (exept a constant, as we have seen). The rate of convergence will be determined by the proximity of this guess to the actual solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm can be decribed as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Divide the region of interest into a grid. The region must be enclosed by boundaries with known values of $V$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Assign all boundary points their values, and all interior cells an arbitrary potential (preferably a reasonable guess)\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  sweep the internal cells by rows or columns and calculate the new values of $V$ as the average in the four neighboring points.\n",
    "    \n",
    "4.  Repeat the sweep using the values obtained in the previous iteration, until the potential does not change within certain level of accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Iterative methods\n",
    "\n",
    "The method that iterates over a spatial grid can take many forms. There of this forms are\n",
    "- Jacobi Method: updates each grid point using the average of its four nearest neighbors without modifying values within the same iteration.\n",
    "- Gauss-Seidel Method: updates each grid point ``in-place'', that is new values are used immediately in the same iteration.\n",
    "- Successive Over-Relaxation (SOR): updates grid points by using a relaxation factor $$V_{i,j} = (1-\\omega)V_{i,j}^{old}+\\frac{\\omega}{4}\\left(V_{i+1,j}+V_{i-1,j}+V_{i,j+1}+V_{i,j-1}\\right)$$\n",
