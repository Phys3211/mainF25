    "Neural networks are the workhorse of breakthroughs in machine learning in the last decade. The reason for this is that they are able to learn complex non-linear relationships between inputs and outputs. In this notebook, we will explore the basics of neural networks and how to implement them in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity, we'll use so-called fully connected deep neural networks. It sounds mysterios, but it's just a function, given by \n",
    "\n",
    "$y = f(x) = \\sigma(W_2 \\sigma(W_1 x + b_1) + b_2)$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $x$ is the input, $y$ is the output, $W_1$ and $W_2$ are matrices of weights, $b_1$ and $b_2$ are vectors of biases, and $\\sigma$ is a non-linear function called the activation function. The activation function is applied element-wise to its input.  The number of layers in the network is the depth of the network, and the number of neurons in each layer is the width of the network. The number of neurons in the input layer is the dimensionality of the input, and the number of neurons in the output layer is the dimensionality of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "The weights and biases are the parameters of the neural network. When the neural network is initialized on your computer these are drawn randomly from a distribution, but the process of machine learning involves some optimization process on the parameters to achieve some goal -- winning at chess, generating fake images of galaxies, classifying phases of matter, etc etc.  Parameters that are not updated during learning are called hyperparameters. The depth and width of the network are hyperparameters in this example."
